A man walking his dog in Clacton, Essex, has found a tiny fossilised poo that is thought to be around 40 million years old. The coprolite, as it is known, is about the size of a golf ball and is believed to have come from a small dinosaur. The man has donated the coprolite to a local Museum, where it will be put on display for visitors to see.

The coprolite is a valuable scientific specimen, as it can provide clues about the diet and behavior of dinosaurs. It is also a reminder of the long and rich history of Clacton, which is known for its dinosaur fossils.

The man who found the coprolite is hoping that his discovery will encourage others to go fossil hunting in Clacton. "There are probably lots more tiny fossils out there, just waiting to be found," he said.

So if you're ever in Clacton, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for a tiny dinosaur poo!
